# Sparsifying even further
Making the attention mechanism more sparse could potentially improve the performance of the model in handling long sequences, as it will reduce the computational complexity. Here are three possible approaches:

**1. Top-k Attention:**
For each query, instead of calculating attention scores with all key-value pairs, we can select the top-k scoring key-value pairs to calculate the attention output. 

Psuedocode:
```
for each query in Q:
    calculate attention scores with all keys in K
    select top-k scoring keys and their corresponding values
    calculate the attention output only with selected top-k keys-values pairs
```

**2. Block-based Attention:**
Split the input into several blocks, and for each query in a block, we only calculate attention scores with keys in the same block or neighboring blocks.

Psuedocode:
```
split input into blocks of size b
for each query in block_i:
    calculate attention scores with keys in block_i, block_{i-1} and block_{i+1}
    calculate the attention output
```

**3. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based Attention:**
LSH can reduce the complexity of the attention mechanism from quadratic to linear. It works by hashing the queries and keys into several buckets, and for each query, it only needs to calculate attention scores with keys in the same bucket.

Psuedocode:
```
hash queries and keys into several buckets using LSH
for each query in bucket_i:
    calculate attention scores with keys in the same bucket
    calculate the attention output
```

Now, here are the implementations of the above methods. Please note that to use these in your existing `DilatedAttention` model, you may need to integrate these into your `forward` method.

**1. Top-k Attention:**
```python
class TopKAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, k):
        super(TopKAttention, self).__init__()
        self.k = k

    def forward(self, Q, K, V):
        attention_scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1))  # calculate attention scores
        top_k_scores, top_k_indices = torch.topk(attention_scores, self.k, dim=-1)  # select top-k scores and their indices
        top_k_scores = torch.nn.functional.softmax(top_k_scores, dim=-1)  # apply softmax to get attention weights
        top_k_values = torch.gather(V, -2, top_k_indices)  # gather corresponding values
        output = torch.matmul(top_k_scores, top_k_values)  # calculate attention output

        return output
```

**2. Block-based Attention:**
```python
class BlockAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, block_size):
        super(BlockAttention, self).__init__()
        self.block_size = block_size

    def forward(self, Q, K, V):
        num_blocks = Q.size(-2) // self.block_size
        output = []
        for i in range(num_blocks):
            q = Q[:, i*self.block_size:(i+1)*self.block_size, :]
            k = K[:, max(0, i-1)*self.block_size:min(num_blocks, i+2)*self.block_size, :]
            v = V[:, max(0, i-1)*self.block_size:min(num_blocks, i+2)*self.block_size, :]
            attention_scores = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1))
            attention_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(attention_scores, dim=-1)
            attention_output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, v)
            output.append(attention_output)

        output = torch.cat(output, dim=-2)
        return output
```

**3. LSH-based Attention:**
Implementing LSH-based attention can be complex as it requires a suitable hashing function. As such, I'd recommend using existing implementations like [LSHAttention](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/model.html#transformers.LSHSelfAttention) from the Hugging Face's Transformers library. This layer applies locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to enable long-range sequence attention with linear time and memory complexity.
