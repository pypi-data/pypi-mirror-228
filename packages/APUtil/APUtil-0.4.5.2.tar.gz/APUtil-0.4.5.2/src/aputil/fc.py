"""
Provides some utility functions to work with feature classes and arcpy.

`use_memory()` is a function-based context manager allowing to use a memory
feature class that is automatically deleted from the memory after using
when used with the `with` statement. 

```python
import arcpy
from aputil import fc

arcpy.env.workspace = r"c:\data"

with fc.use_memory() as copied:

    print(arcpy.Exists(copied))  # false (not yet)
    arcpy.management.CopyFeatures("buildings.shp", copied)
    print(arcpy.Exists(copied))  # true

print(arcpy.Exists(copied))  # false
```
