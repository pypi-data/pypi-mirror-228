"""
`tcursor` is a generator wrapping an `arcpy.da.SearchCursor` using a namedtuple.

```python
import arcpy
from aputil import tcursor

feature_class = "points.shp"
with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(feature_class, ["FieldName"]) as cursor:
    for row in tcursor(cursor):
        print(row.FieldName)  # instead of row[0]
```
