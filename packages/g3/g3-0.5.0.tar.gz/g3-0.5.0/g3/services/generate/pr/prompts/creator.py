 what was changed in this commit. A pull request is a github event that takes place in software development
 when a contributor is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project
 repository. The pull request contains a description of what changed and why it changed.
 The pull request's title should be a sentence containing a title summing up the provided commits.
 Leave an new empty line always after the title. The pull request's description should be under
 {config.pr_description_max_words} words in total and it should be helpful to the reader in order to
 understand the changes made. Mention each change only once and summarize listing only the most important changes.
 The reader of the pull request description needs to understand the changes in order to approve the pull request
 or ask for the needed changes. If Jira tickets are provided then include them in the pull request description as a
