## GPT Engine

GPT Engine is a Python module that allows you to interact with the OpenAI API to generate text. It can be used for a variety of tasks, such as:

### Generating text: 
This task allows you to generate text in a variety of formats, such as poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
### Answering questions:
This task allows you to ask OpenAI questions and get informative answers, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange.
### Following instructions: 
This task allows you to provide OpenAI with instructions and have it complete your requests thoughtfully.
To use GPT Engine, you will need to create a free account with OpenAI and get an API key. You can then install the GPT Engine module using pip:

pip install gptEngine
Once you have installed the module, you need to create a credentials.ini file in the same directory as your project. The credentials.ini file should contain the following information:

[openai]
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
The OPENAI_API_KEY parameter is your OpenAI API key. You can get your API key from your OpenAI account.

Once you have created the credentials.ini file, you can create a GPT Engine object:

engine = GPTEngine(main_task="Generate Text", input_prompt="Write a poem about love.")
The main_task parameter specifies the type of task that you want to perform, and the input_prompt parameter specifies the input text that you want to provide to OpenAI.

To generate text, you can call the generate_response() method:

response = engine.generate_response("Convert the document to a poem.")
The generate_response() method takes the instructions for how to convert the document as input. The response from OpenAI will be returned as a string.

The response from OpenAI will be a new document that has been converted based on the instructions that you have provided.

For more information, please see the GPT Engine documentation: https://github.com/mbsuraj/gptEngine/blob/main/README.md.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
