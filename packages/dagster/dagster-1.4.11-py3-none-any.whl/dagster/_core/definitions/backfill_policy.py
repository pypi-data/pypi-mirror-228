    """An BackfillPolicy specifies how Dagster should attempt to backfill an asset.

    There are two main kinds of auto-materialize policies: single run and multi run. And it only applies
    to partitioned assets.

    In essence, an asset with a single run backfill policy will be take a single dagster run to backfill
    all of its partitions at once, if the asset is partitioned.

    An asset with a multi run backfill policy will take multiple dagster runs to backfill all of its partitions.
    Each dagster run will backfill a subset of the partitions, the number of partitions to backfill in each
    dagster run is specified by the `max_partitions_per_run` parameter.

    For example:

    - If an asset has 100 partitions, and the `max_partitions_per_run` is set to 10, then it will
    be backfilled in 10 dagster runs, each dagster run will backfill 10 partitions.

    - If an asset has 100 partitions, and the `max_partitions_per_run` is set to 11, then it will
    be backfilled in 10 dagster runs, the first 9 dagster runs will backfill 11 partitions, and the last one run
    will backfill the remaining 9 partitions.

    For an asset that is not partitioned, backfill policy should not be assigned to it since we can only backfill
    such asset as a whole.

    **Warning:**

    Constructing an BackfillPolicy directly is not recommended as the API is subject to change.
    BackfillPolicy.single_run() and BackfillPolicy.multi_run(max_partitions_per_run=x) are the recommended API.
