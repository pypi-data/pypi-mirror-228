LLMs, such as Transformer-based models, have shown impressive performance in various domains but struggle when it comes to longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts. Current pre-training schemes truncate training sequences to a fixed length, and even with relative positional encoding, LLMs struggle to generate coherent texts or perform downstream tasks after longer contexts.\n\nThe authors investigate the main out-of-distribution factors contributing to this problem and propose LM-Infinite as an efficient solution. LM-Infinite only requires a Î›-shaped attention mask and a distance limit, without any parameter updates or learning. It can be applied to different LLMs using relative-position encoding methods. LM-Infinite demonstrates consistent fluency and generation quality for sequences as long as 32k tokens on datasets like ArXiv and OpenWebText2, with a decoding speedup of 2.72x. Furthermore, it continues to perform well on inputs much longer than training lengths in downstream tasks like passkey retrieval, where vanilla models fail immediately.\n\nPaper Link\n\n# Appreciation\n* Lucidrains\n* Agorians\n\n\n\n# Install\n\n\n# Usage\n\n# Architecture\n\n# Todo\n\n\n# License\nMIT\n\n# Citations\n\n',
