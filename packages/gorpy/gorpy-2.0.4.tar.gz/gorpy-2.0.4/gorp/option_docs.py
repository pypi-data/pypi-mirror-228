This concludes our overview of gorp.jsonpath syntax.
We've at least touched on all of the key features, the most important of which are:
    - 'vv' to separate key constraints from value constraints.
    - 'nn' to turn on 'math mode' (see math_eval.compute.__doc__ for more info).
    - 'zz' to allow regex matching of keys (by default keys must be matched exactly).
    - '..' to turn on recursive search.
    - 'gg' to create GlobalConstraints that allow comparisons of multiple values in the
        same iterable.
    - '~~@' and '~~^' to get children and parents, respectively .
    - '!!' to reverse the selectivity of key and value matching.
    - 'AGG<function>BY<int/slice>' to calculate aggregates with grouping.""",
