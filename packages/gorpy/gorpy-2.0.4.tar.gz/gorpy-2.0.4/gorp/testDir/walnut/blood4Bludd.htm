<p>In the eyes of Bludd, the <strong>strong</strong> and the <b>bold</b> appear the same.<br>
But the sages have ordained that to be strong implies greater meaning than to be <small>merely bold</small>. So it is written.

hsl(0,x%,y%) colors are defined by hue, saturation, and lightness, respectively.
The hue is a position on the color wheel. 0 and 360 are both red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.
The saturation is the intensity of the color. Any shade of gray has 0% saturation, and hue is irrelevant.
The lightness determines how bright the color is. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white.
A high lightness would be a very washed-out color. A lower lightness would be darker.
hsla(0,x%,y%,z) gives you hsl plus the alpha (transparency) option just like rgba.
