!--rgba is like rgb, except it has a final attribute, alpha (transparency) which can range from 0 to 1.
The higher the alpha, the more transparent something is.--
!--Also remember that the lower the numbers are for a color, the darker it is. rgb(0,0,0) is black,
and rgb(255,255,255) is white.--
bdo dir=rtl style=colorrgb(150,150,150);This line will be written from right to leftbdo
!--Notice that rgb(150,150,150) is gray. In general, any equal mixture of rgb will be a shade of gray.--
p style=color #f5a9b0;this text's color was set with hex color encoding.p
--Hex colors are set off with a #, and the format is RRGGBB, where each space can have 0-9 or a-f, because
it's hexadecimal.--

hsl(0,x%,y%) colors are defined by hue, saturation, and lightness, respectively.
The hue is a position on the color wheel. 0 and 360 are both red, 120 is green, 240 is blue.
The saturation is the intensity of the color. Any shade of gray has 0% saturation, and hue is irrelevant.
The lightness determines how bright the color is. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white.
A high lightness would be a very washed-out color. A lower lightness would be darker.
hsla(0,x%,y%,z) gives you hsl plus the alpha (transparency) option just like rgba.
