    RULES FOR PARSING AN ENTIRE JSON PATH ('x'):

        * x is split into path layers or substeps by one of the delimiters
        {'~~', '~~@', '~~^+'), '~~}'}.

            * '~~' means that the preceding path substep serves as a "check";
            (de/a)scent to a child or parent cannot proceed unless all checks
            at a path layer are satisfied.
            There can be any number of checks at a path layer.

            * '~~@' comes at the end of a path layer; it means that once all the
            checks are satisfied at the current path layer, you begin searching
            the CHILDREN of all nodes that satisfied the preceding check.

            * '~~^+' also comes at the end of a path layer; it means that
            once all the checks are satisfied at the current path layer, you
            begin searching the n^th ancestor of the current level of json,
            where n is the number of '^' characters.

            * '~~}' can be supplied as the last three characters of a path.
            It means that if the all the checks in the current layer of json were
            satisfied, you return the CURRENT LAYER, not children or ancestors.

            * Descent-type-search (as specified by '~~@') is the default, so the
            final path layer will always return the children of all matched nodes
            unless the path is terminated with '~~}' or '~~^+'.

        * '..' switches json_extract into recursive search mode.
        Recursive search mode is off by default.

        * '!!' as its own path layer or at the beginning of another path layer
        is treated as a special indicator that toggles reverse_selectivity mode.

        * 'zz' at the beginninng of another path layer toggles fuzzy_keys, which
        changes the fuzzy_keys parameter of the Filters created by this function.

        * 'gg' at any point in a path layer (including on a "check" filter in a
        multi-substep path layer) creates a GlobalConstraint rather than a Filter.

        * '~~ss<func of one variable>' as the FINAL ELEMENT IN A PATH
        (even after '~~}') ends the path with a :class:`Mutator` object that
        can be used to perform in-place transformations on the JSON after paths
        have been found by json_extract() or JsonPath.extract().

        * 'AGG<func of one iterable variable>(BY<integer|IntRange>)' as the
        FINAL ELEMENT IN A PATH (even after '~~}') ends the path with a
        :class:`Aggregator` object that can be used to aggregate the data found
        by json_extract or JsonPath.extract().


    RULES FOR PARSING A SINGLE PATH SUBSTEP (performed by parse_json_path_step):

        * 'nn' at any point in a path substep toggles "compute mode".
        While the parser is in "compute mode", it interprets everything as a
        mathematical expression, and passes it into :func:`math_eval.compute`.
        Thus, it is easier to include string filters at the beginning of a tuple
        path substep and numeric filters at the end of a tuple path substep.

        * ';;' separates two elements within the path substep.

        * '&&' separates two elements within the path substep, and every
        consecutive element joined by '&&' is bundled together;
        so 'cond1;;cond2&&cond3;;cond4'
        would filter on cond1 OR (cond2 AND cond3) OR cond4.

        * 'vv' is a delimiter.
        everything after 'vv' in the path substep is a filter on VALUES and
        everything before 'vv' is a filter on KEYS.
            * Note that 'vv' resets the 'nn' flag.
            This means that you need to use 'nn' to turn on compute mode
            separately for values and keys.
            * Note also that for a GlobalConstraint, everything after the 'vv'
            flag is a filter on the iterable as a whole.

        * By default, a path substep must match at least one key filter AND at
        least one value filter, assuming both key and value filters are supplied.

        * '||' is an optional indicator that can be used with 'vv'.
        When '||' is supplied, the filter at that path substep only requires that
        a key filter OR a value filter is matched.

            * The '||' flag does not do anything when used on a GlobalConstraint.

        * When not in compute mode, all strings (including numeric strings) are
        treated as regular expressions if fuzzy_keys = True and not inside a
        :class:`GlobalConstraint`.
        Otherwise, they are treated as plain strings.
