class Filter:
    """Used to check keys, array indices, and values in nested Python objects.
        Note that in this context "keys" means both dict keys and array indices.

    **Arguments**:

    *keys_in*: Function that performs a comparison, IntRange, number, string, or
    tuple that contains any number of nums, strings, comparison funcs,
    :class:`math_eval.IntRange`, or tuples.
    If this is a tuple, a key that matches *anything* in the tuple is a match.
    Any tuple within the tuple represents a set of conditions that are
    bundled and must be simultaneously satisfied.
    If this is empty, all keys are matched.

    *vals_in*: Same as keys_in, but tests values in a key-value pair.

    *key_or_val*: Bool, default False. If true, any key-value pair where the key
        matches keys_in OR vals_in is considered a match.

    *action*: str: {'check', 'down', 'stay', 'up'+str(integer)}
    This determines how json_extract treats key-value pairs that are matched
    by this filter.
        * If the action is 'check', there must be another filter in the filter
        layer. This filter only makes assertions.
        * If the action is 'down', json_extract will search downwards (to the
        children) of any keys that are matched by this filter.
        * If the action is 'stay', json_extract will return the container holding
        the keys that match this filter.
        * If the action is 'up'+str(integer), json_extract will search the
        integer^th ancestor (e.g., 1 = parent, 3 = great-grandparent) of the
        key matched by this filter.

    *fuzzy_keys*: bool. If False, IntRanges match array indices but not dict keys
    and numbers and strings in keys_in must match keys and indices exactly.
    If this is True, keys can be tested "fuzzily" by comparison functions and
    IntRanges, and all strings are treated as regular expressions.
    Value testing is "fuzzy" regardless of the value of fuzzy_keys.

    **Other attributes**:

    *keyfuncs*: List of functions that perform key matching based on keys_in.
    *valfuncs*: List of functions that perform value matching based on vals_in.

    **Methods**:

    *in*: The test "(k, v) in filt" will return True if the key-value
    pair k,v matches the filter "filt".

    *callable*: "filt(k, v)" returns the same thing as "(k, v) in filt".
