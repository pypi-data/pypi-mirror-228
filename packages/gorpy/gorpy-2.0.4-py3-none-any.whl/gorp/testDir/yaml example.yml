# --- marks the start of a YAML document
- YAML example
- don't use tabs in the file; parsers don't like that
- If you include emojis like ðŸ˜ƒ in a YAML file you will produce a UnicodeDecodeError when Python tries to read the file. ðŸ˜ƒ is a rare exception.
- a hashtable: # a comment
    baz: qux
    foo: bar
- - blutentharst
  - fjordlak # the annihilator
  - grodnir # the voracious
- '1' # will be interpreted as a string representing the number 1
- 1 # will be interpreted as the integer 1
- 1.0 # will be interpreted as the float 1.0

# you can have multiple documents in the same file
How to open this document with Python:
  - import yaml
  - with open(r"C:\Users\molso\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\yaml example.yml") as f: 
    - docgenerator = yaml.safe_load_all(f) # yaml.load is deprecated because it's unsafe; this returns a generator
    - '' # note that we can't use yaml.safe_load() because there are two docs in this file.
    - # this line will be represented as None or NULL or the language equivalent in this array.
    - docs = list(docgenerator) # returns a list of Python objects corresponding to the two docs contained in this file
  - see also https://pynative.com/python-yaml/
# Don't terminate the file with "---". "---" only indicates the START of the file.
