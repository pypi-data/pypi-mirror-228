__web-minify__ is the all-in-one just-works-out-of-the-box does-what-you-want highly-opinionated web minifier&trade;

- web-minify is [available on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/octomy/web-minify).

## Goals of this tool:

> NOTE: We have not reached all these goals yet, please see next sections.

| Goal   |      Status |
|--------|-------------|
| All-in-one compressor/obfuscator/minifier/cruncher for most of the common static web formats | See [list of supported formats](#supported-formats). | ‚úÖ |
| Installable via PyPi on platforms supported by Python 3+ | ‚úÖ |
| No dependencies on large non-python tool such as nodejs | ‚úÖ |
| Support for images formats such as [.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) and [.jpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) | ‚úÖ |
| Support for vector graphics formats such as [.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) | ‚úÖ |
| Support for style sheet formats such as .css and [.sass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language) | ‚úÖ |
| Support for script formats such as .js | ‚úÖ |
| Support for template formats such as .jinja | ‚úÖ |
| Support for markup formats such as .html | ‚úÖ |
| Handle intertwined formats such as JS and CSS inside HTML | ‚ùå |
| Does what you hoped by default (i.e. highly opinionated) | ‚úÖ |
| Can be tweaked to do what you didn't want (i.e. flexible) | ‚úÖ |
| Small and dependency free (i.e. implemented in pure python if possible) | Only tested/used on Linux. There is hope for OSX/BSD/Posix but YMMV on Windows. |
| Available as library as well as command-line tool | ‚úÖ |
| Easily extensible; adding another backend can be done by writing one function | ‚úÖ |
| Cross platform, supports many Python 3.x versions | Only tested on Python 3.7 |


# Getting started

__web-minify__ can be used and hacked on in a myriad of different ways. 

## Use web-minify as a module from your code

web-minify is [available in PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/web-minify/).

```shell
# Install web-minify into your current Python environment
pip install web-minify

```

Now you can access it's features from your code:

<details>

```Python
import web_minify

settings = {
    "input": "my_originals_dir/",
    "output": "my_processed_dir/",
}

# Instanciate processor with settings we want to use
p = web_minify.processor.Processor(settings)


# Process files as per settings (this is equivalent to the commandline mode)
p. process_file()


# Process a list of files relative to input, and output them depending on settings
p. process_files_list(["input_file.svg", "input_file.html"])


# Process a single file (disregard input/output from settings
p.process_file("some_input_file.svg", "some_output_file.svg")

```

</details>


## Use web-minify as a command line tool

web-minify is [available in PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/web-minify/).

```shell
# Install web-minify into your current Python environment
pip install web-minify

```

```shell
# Run the web-minify cli tool with help argument to see detailed usage
web-minify --help

```


The output looks like this:

<details>

```shell
$ ./web-minify.py --help

${README_CMD_OUTPUT}

```

</details>

## Developing web-minify

web-minify is [available on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/octomy/web-minify).

__web-minify welcomes PRs!__ If you want to contribute we welcome your code contriburtions! We are proud of the fact that this project is a true meritocracy.

Example: extending web-minify to support additional formats is done by a very simple interface:

1. Put a module under `web-minify/web_minify/handlers/your_format`. This can either be a module folder or python module source file. See [css/](web_minify/handlers/css) or [html.py](web_minify/handlers/html.py) for example implementations.
2. Include the new function in `__all__` in `web-minify/web_minify/handlers/__init__.py`
3. Register the new function in `self.processor_map` in `web-minify/web_minify/processor.py`

Easy as ü•ß!

# Other Notable Features

1. Supports recursive scanning of directories
2. Supports spitting out .gz versions of files to speed up serving of static files
3. Supports some controls over each format's processing
4. Supports change detection and watch mode
5. Made to be somewhat [extensible](#extending-web-minify)

# Known Limitations and Problems:

1. Compression of modern .js haves some bugs. We welcome PRs!
2. Some of the usage patterns of the command line tool are not implemented yet. We welcome PRs!
3. Codebase has ZERO tests. We welcome PRs!
