    """
    Score sorting for mixed mode scripts. This mode will be used by default when
    combining scores across multiple maps that use different mode scripts.

    It works by performing the default score sorting for each map individually,
    then giving out "Placement Points" to each player based on their ranking in
    the map. All the "Placement Points" for a player are summed across all maps
    and then the scores are re-sorted to determine final rankings.

    "Placement Points" are allocated using the number of players in the map as
    the point value given to the highest ranked player. Then each player down
    the rankings gets 1 less point than the player ranked above them.


    Recommended Modes: Any combination that have their own default sorting mode
    Sorting: Points for each map placement descending
