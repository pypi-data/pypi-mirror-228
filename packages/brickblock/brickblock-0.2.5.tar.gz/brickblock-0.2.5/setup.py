A `Space` represents a 3D cartesian coordinate space. It contains objects, and when a user wants a visualisation, they render the current state of the `Space` - the rendered state is known as a `Scene`.\n\nThere are objects used for composing visualisations in Brickblock, such as the `Cube`. Objects can be added into the `Space` with a degree of control over their visual presentation: transparency, colour, line widths. They can also be mutated - and can be selected by name, base vector, or various IDs.\n\nHaving these abstractions allows programmers to more easily create animated 3D visualisations, like GIFs. You define a `Space`, adding and mutating objects to evolve the state, and the `Scene` objects are persisted to enable sequences of images for use in GIFs.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are more than welcome! There is a very rough TODO in [todo.md](todo.md) that outlines both short- and long-term goals for the library. However, there are some rules:\n\n* Always follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n* All the tests should be passing with your change\n* Explain your change (PR template coming soon)\n* Add relevant tests and docstrings\n* Format your changes with `black`\n",
