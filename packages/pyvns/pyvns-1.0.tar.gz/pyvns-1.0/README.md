# Visual Novel Script

Visual Novel Script, short for VNS, is a universal scripting language created with the goal of creating a language that allows visual novel developers to write once and compile everywhere, across different platforms, game libraries, and programming languages.

Unlike Ren'py, the visual novel script is more like writing a story instead of writing a program. The developer also have the choice to make their own implementation.
