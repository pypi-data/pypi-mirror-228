```
See Minecraft documentation for location syntax, orientation system, and what are opaque blocks.

See the JSON section for how to write a music JSON file.

See the Generation section for what the generated structure will look like.

## JSON

The user writes a JSON file that specifies a music composition. It is first compiled into python objects and checked for all errors, then generated into Minecraft noteblocks. 

The file should be in this format:
```json5
{
    // Composition

    // Optional arguments
    
    "time": [how many redstone units in a bar],
    // A redstone unit is the shortest unit of time in a composition.
    // This value controls both the fastest playable note and the composition's time signature.
    // For example, if the time signature is 3/4, and the composition contains 16th notes,
    // the required number of units in a bar is 12.
    // Default value is 16, that is, 4/4 time and the ability to play 16th notes.

    "delay": [how many redstone ticks for each redstone unit],
    // One redstone tick is 0.1s. This value effectively controls the tempo.
    // For example, if time is 16 and delay is 1 (defaults), it's the tempo quarter note = 150 bpm.
    // Must be from 1 to 4. Default value is 1.
    
    "beat": [how many redstone units in a beat],
    // Does not affect the build, but is useful for writing notes (explained later).
    // Default value is 1.

    "instrument": [noteblock instrument to play the notes],
    // See Minecraft's documentation for all available instruments.
    // Default value is "harp".

    "dynamic": [how many noteblocks to play each note],
    // Must be from 0 to 4, where 0 is silent and 4 is loudest.
    // Default value is 2.

    "transpose": [transpose the entire composition, in semitones],
    // Default value is 0.

    "sustain": [whether to sustain the notes],
    // Minecraft noteblocks cannot naturally sustain. 
    // If set to true, the notes will fake sustain with tremolo.
    // Default value is false.

    // Mandatory argument
    "voices":
    [
        {
            // Voice 1

            // Optional arguments

            "name": [voice name],
            // Does not affect the build, but may be useful for your own reference.

            "transpose": [transpose this voice, in semitones],
            // This value is compounded with the composition's transposition.
            // Default value is 0.

            "delay": [override the composition delay for this voice],

            "beat": [override the composition beat for this voice],

            "instrument": [override the composition instrument for this voice],

            "dynamic": [override the composition dynamic for this voice],

            "sustain": [override the composition sustain for this voice],

            // Mandatory argument
            "notes":
            [
                // There are two ways to write notes.

                // First is as an object, like this:
                {
                    // Note 1

                    // Optional arguments

                    "transpose": [transpose this note, in semitones],
                    // This value is compounded with the voice's transposition.
                    // Default value is 0.

                    "beat": [override the voice beat for this note],

                    "delay": [override the voice delay for this note],

                    "dynamic": [override the voice dynamic for this note],

                    "instrument": [override the voice instrument for this note],

                    "sustain": [override the voice sustain for this note],

                    // (sort-of) Mandatory argument
                    // If a note object does not have the "name" value, it's not an actual note,
                    // but a syntactic sugar to apply the other key-value pairs
                    // to all subsequent notes in its voice.
                    // If a subsequent note defines its own values, some of which
                    // overlap with these values, the note's values take precedence.
                    "name": "[note name][octave] [duration]",

                    // Valid note names are "r" (rest) and "c", "cs", "db", etc.
                    // where "s" is for sharp and "b" is for flat. 
                    // Double sharps, double flats are supported. 
                    // No octave value for rests.

                    // Valid octaves are 1 to 7.
                    // Octave number can be inferred from the instrument's range.
                    // For example, using the harp whose range is F#3 - F#5, 
                    // "fs" is inferred as "fs 4", "fs^" as "fs 5", and "fs_" as "fs 3".
                    // See Minecraft's documentation for the range of each instrument.

                    // Duration is the number of redstone units. 
                    // For example, if a voice has 4/4 time and uses time 8, 
                    // a quarter note has duration 2.
                    // If duration is omitted, it will be the beat number.
                    // If a duration number is followed by "b" (stands for "beats"),
                    // the number is multiplied by the beat number.
                    // Dotted rhythm is supported. If a duration value is followed by a ".",
                    // its value is multiplied by 1.5.
                    // If multiple values are given, they will be summed up, 
                    // for example, a note named "cs4 1 2 3" is the same as "cs4 6".
                    // If sustain is false (default), a note with duration n
                    // is the same as the note with duration 1 and n-1 rests;
                    // otherwise, it is n repeated notes of duration 1.

                    // Another optional argument
                    "trill": "[trill note name][trill octave] [trill duration]"
                    // The rules for trill name is the same as main note's name. See above.
                    // The trill starts from the main note, 
                    // then ossilates between two notes for "trill duration" units, 
                    // then rests for the remaining of the main note's duration.
                    // If sustain is enabled, rather than rest the trill will be followed by a tremlo.
                    // Named "trill" but is far more useful than only performing trills,
                    // because of the freedom of choosing trill duration:
                    // 1: indistinguishable from a regular note
                    // 2: appoggiatura
                    // 3: mordent
                    // 4+: short trill
                    // trill duration = main note duration: full trill
    
                },

                {
                    // Note 2
                    // etc.
                },

                // Note 3, etc.

                // Another way is to write it as a string, like this:
                "[note name][octave] [duration]",
                // which is syntactic sugar for
                {
                    // omit all optional arguments
                    "name": "[note name][octave] [duration]"
                },

                // Notes are automatically divided into bars based on the composition's time,
                // no user action is needed. However, the user may find these helpers useful.
                // 1) A pseudo-note "|" is to assert a barline. The compiler will check if
                //    a barline is appropriate at that position, and raise and error if it's not.
                // 2) A note "||" is to rest for the entire bar. It is a syntactic sugar for
                "|", "r [the number of redstone units in a bar]",
                // 3) Both "|" and "||" can optionally be followed by a number, which asserts bar number.
                //    The compiler will check if it's the correct bar number at that position
                //    and raise an error if it it isn't.
                //    For example, to rest for the first 2 bars and start on bar 3:
                "||1", 
                "||2", 
                "| 3", "c", "d", "e", "c"
            ]
        },
        
        {
            // Voice 2
            // etc.
        }
        
        // Voice 3, etc.
    ]
}
```
For an example, see "example.json" which writes the Frere Jacques round in C major for 3 voices, and see "World" for the build result.

## Generation
Each redstone unit is a group that looks like this:
```
x (+/-)
â†‘
|            [noteblock]
|            [noteblock]
| [repeater]   [block] 
|            [noteblock]
|            [noteblock]

|------------------------> z (+/-)
```

The number of noteblocks depends on the note's dynamic value, this diagram shows one with maximum value 4.

The generated structure of one voice looks like this:
```
x (+/-)
â†‘
| 
| [BAR 5] etc.
|          â†‘
|          -- unit <- unit <- unit [BAR 4]
|                               â†‘
| [BAR 3] unit -> unit -> unit --
|           â†‘
|           - unit <- unit <- unit [BAR 2]
|                               â†‘
| [BAR 1] unit -> unit -> unit --
|
O------------------------------------------> z (+/-)
```
The x-axis goes + or - depending on the x-orientation. And similarly with the z-axis.

Each voice is a vertical layer on top of another. They are built in the order that they are written in the JSON file. They go from bottom to top (+) or top to bottom (-) depending on the y-orientation.

The "O" of the first voice is the build location. Upon being called, the generator starts at the build location, (fills the space with air if --clear), and generates the structure according to the build orientation.
