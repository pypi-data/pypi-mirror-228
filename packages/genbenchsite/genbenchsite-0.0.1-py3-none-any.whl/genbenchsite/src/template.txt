# This repository is a Demo for [**GenBenchSite**](https://github.com/White-On/BenchSite), a Benchmarking tools for libraries.

## Files organisation

- `config/`: Contains the configurations files for the entire project. The `config.ini` file contains the configuration for the benchmarking process and the configuration for the website. Most of those configurations are **OPTIONAL** and comes with default values.
- `targets/`: Contains the targets to be benchmarked. Each target is a folder containing a `config.ini` file containing the configuration for the target and some cosmetic files .
- `themes/`: Contains the themes for the website. Each theme is a folder containing other forler for each task and a `config.ini` file containing the configuration for the theme and the code to run for the benchmarking process. there is also the `theme.ini` to configure the theme.
- `pages/`: Contrains the pages of the website generated by the benchmarking process.

## How to use

## Website UI

You'll find the website in the pages folder and is composed of `index.html`, the main pages `content/`, with all the pages generated by the benchmarking process,`script/` for  all the *javascript* files, `style/` with all the *css* files, and `assets/` with all the assets needed for the website.

the main page is `index.html` and should look like this:

You can navigate through the pages using the navigation bar on the left side of the page. The **data** created by the benchmarking process can be downloaded using the **Raw Data** button on the top right of the page.
