class Subset:
    """Delayed subset operation, based on Bioconductor's ``DelayedArray::DelayedSubset`` class.
    This will slice the array along one or more dimensions, equivalent to the outer product of subset indices.

    This class is intended for developers to construct new :py:class:`~delayedarray.DelayedArray.DelayedArray`
    instances. In general, end users should not be interacting with ``Subset`` objects directly.

    Attributes:
        seed:
            Any object that satisfies the seed contract,
            see :py:class:`~delayedarray.DelayedArray.DelayedArray` for details.

        subset (Tuple[Sequence[int], ...]):
            Tuple of length equal to the dimensionality of ``seed``, containing the subsetted
            elements for each dimension.
            Each entry should be a vector of integer indices specifying the elements of the
            corresponding dimension to retain, where each integer is non-negative and less than the
            extent of the dimension. Unsorted and/or duplicate indices are allowed.
