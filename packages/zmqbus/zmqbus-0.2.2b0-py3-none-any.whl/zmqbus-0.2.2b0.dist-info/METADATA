A bus implementation for Python using ZeroMQ
============================================

_zmqbus_ is package for Python that allows for communication between
collaborative processes in a bus fashion on the same machine. The bus
allows connected parties to subscribe and publish messages, with the
ability to direct messages to specific connections. It also supports
request/response messages for remote procedure calls (RPC), where
connections can send request and receive responses from well-known
addresses registered in the bus.

**IMPORTANT**: _zmqbus_ is still beta software. Use in production is
strongly discouraged.
