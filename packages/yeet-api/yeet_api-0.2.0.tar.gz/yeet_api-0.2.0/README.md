# yeet-api
Welcome to `yeet-api`! This is where the API used by (the upcoming) yeet-cli
resides. This API is written in Python and is aimed to be as friendly as
possible towards the community, so you can build your own tools, too.

_Note that currently `yeet-api` is in major development, and is currently
unstable to be used._
