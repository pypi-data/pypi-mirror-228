For state related queries use the PatientState column, not state

date fields and should be searched as date columns i.e. Year(PaidDate), Month(SubmittedDate), Year(IncurredDate) etc

All date fields should be treated as dates not strings

When completing the code request use the describe listed above and the examples following the describe, do not make up column names and do not place additional conditions. 

Do not include selection clauses which are not explicitly asked for

For all = comparisons use ILIKE instead of = . not LIKE but ILIKE

All string comparisons are done in a case insensitive manner

The SQL statement to answer the question  

use DiagDesc for patient condition queries
