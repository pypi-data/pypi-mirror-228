You may also want to include the config file with your published code for reproducibility.


Install
-------

As as user:

.. code-block::

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cta-observatory/lstmcpipe/master/environment.yml
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate lstmcpipe
    pip install lstmcpipe

This will setup a new enviroment with lstchain and other needed tools available in supported versions.
If you already have your lstchain conda environment, you may simply activate it and install lstmcpipe there using `pip install lstmcpipe`.


HIPERTA (referred to as rta in the following) support is builtin, but no installation instructions can be provided as of now.

Alternatively, you can install `lstmcpipe` in your own enviroment to use different versions of the
analysis pipelines.
WARNING: Due to changing APIs and data models, we cannot support other versions than the ones specified in
the enviroment.

As as developer:

.. code-block::

    git clone https://github.com/cta-observatory/lstmcpipe.git
    cd lstmcpipe
    conda env create -n lstmcpipe_dev -f environment.yml
    conda activate lstmcpipe_dev
    pip install -e .
    pre-commit install

This will setup a pre-commit hook: Given that you are in the right enviroment, it will run and format files you are about
to commit with `black`. (You need to stage the changes again after that). This ensures the formatting of the
code follows our guidelines and there is less work dealing with the code checker in the CI.


Requesting a MC analysis
------------------------
You may find the list of already run productions in the documentation.
Please check in this list that the request you are about to make does not exist already!

As a LST member, you may require a MC analysis with a specific configuration, for example to later analyse a specific source with tuned MC parameters.

To do so, please:

#. `Open a pull request from your fork <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_ into lstMCpipe, adding the desired configuration in a new directory named `date_ProdID` in `production_configs`.
#. You may have a look at the ``production_configs/template_prod`` as an example.
#. Add a descriptive production ID (e.g. ``src***_psf_tuned``) to you directory and configuration.
#. The requested config must contain:

* a lstchain config file (please provide an exhaustive config that will help others and provide a more explicit provenance information)
* a lstmcpipe config file (to generate it, please refer to the documentation)
* a readme with a short description of why you require this analysis to be run. **Do not add information that should not appear publicly** (such as source names) here. If you are requesting a production for a specific new source, please edit `this table on LST wiki <https://www.lst1.iac.es/wiki/index.php/MC_analysis_and_IRF_production#lstmcpipe_productions>`_. Also add the command line to generate the lstmcpipe config, that will help debugging.



The proposed configuration will be tested for validity by continuous integration tests and we will interact with you to run the analysis on the cluster at La Palma.

Depending on the number of requests, we may give priorities.



Quickstart
----------

To generate your lstmcpipe configuration file, use `lstmcpipe_generate_config` command.
If the type of production you want is not listed in the existing ones, you may create your own `PathConfig` class
from an existing one, or generate a config from an existing prod type and edit the file manually.

Once you have your configuration file, you way launch the pipeline with the described stages in the config using:

.. code-block:: python

    lstmcpipe -c config_MC_prod.yml -conf_lst lstchain_*.json [-conf_cta CONFIG_FILE_CTA] [-conf_rta CONFIG_FILE_RTA] [--debug] [--log-file LOG_FILE]

The ``lstmcpipe_start.py`` script is the **orchestrator** of the pipeline, it schedules the stages specified in the
``onsite_MC_prod.yml`` file. All the configuration related with the MC pipe must be declared in this file (stages,
particles to be analysed, zenith, pointing, type of MC production...).

Pipeline-specific configuration options (such as cleaning or model parameters) are declared in a different configuration file,
which is passed via the options ``-conf_lst/-conf_cta/-conf_rta``.

Note: You can always launch this command without fear; there is an intermediate step that verifies and
shows the configuration that you are passing to the pipeline.

The use of slurms jobarrays in the r0_to_dl1 stage in combination with a limited amount of maximum jobs running at the same time
reduces the load on the cluster compared to previous versions,
but **please note** that it still requires a lot of resources to process a full MC
production. Think about other LP-IT cluster users.


Stages
------
After launching of the pipeline all selected tasks will be performed in order.
These are referred to as *stages* and are collected in ``lstmcpipe/stages``.
Following is a short overview over each stage, that can be specified in the configuration.

**r0_to_dl1**

In this stage simtel-files are processed up to datalevel 1 and separated into files for training
and for testing.
For efficiency reasons files are processed in batches: N files (depending on paricle type
as that influences the averages duration of the processing) are submitted as one job in a jobarray.
To group the files together, the paths are saved in files that are passed to
python scripts in ``lstmcpipe/scripts`` which then call the selected pipelines 
processing tool. These are:

- lstchain: lstchain_mc_r0_to_dl1
- ctapipe: ctapipe-stage1
- rta: lstmcpipe_hiperta_r0_to_dl1lstchain (``lstmcpipe/hiperta/hiperta_r0_to_dl1lstchain.py``)


**dl1ab**

As an alternative to the processing of simtel r0 files, existing dl1 files can be reprocessed.
This can be useful to apply different cleanings or alter the images by adding noise etc.
For this to work the old files have to contain images, i.e. they need to have been processed
using the ``no_image: False`` flag in the config.
The config key ``dl1_reference_id`` is used to determine the input files.
Its value needs to be the full prod_id including software versions (i.e. the name of the
directories directly above the dl1 files).
For lstchain the dl1ab script is used, ctapipe can use the same script as for simtel
processing. There is no support for hiperta!


**merge_dl1**

In this stage the previously created dl1 files are merged so that you end up with
train and test datesets for the next stages.


**train_test_split**

Split the dataset into training and testing datasets, performing a random selection of files with the specified ratio
(default=0.5).

**train_pipe**

IMPORTANT: From here on out only ``lstchain`` tools are available. More about that at the end.

In this stage the models to reconstruct the primary particles properties are trained
on the gamma-diffuse and proton train data.
At present this means that random forests are created using lstchains
``lstchain_mc_trainpipe``
Models will be stored in the ``models`` directory.


**dl1_to_dl2**

The previously trained models are evaluated on the merged dl1 files using ``lstchain_dl1_to_dl2`` from
the lstchain package.
DL2 data can be found in ``DL2`` directory.

**dl2_to_irfs**

Point-like IRFs are produced for each set of offset gammas.
The processing is performed by calling ``lstchain_create_irf_files``. 


**dl2_to_sensitivity**
A sensitivity curve is estimated using a script based on pyirf which performs a cut optimisation
similar to EventDisplay.
The script can be found in ``lstmcpipe/scripts/script_dl2_to_sensitivity.py``.
This does not use the IRFs and cuts computed in dl2_to_irfs, so this can not be compared to observed data.
It is a mere benchmark for the pipeline.


Logs and data output
--------------------
**NOTE**: ``lstmcpipe`` expects the data to be located in a specific structure on the cluster.
Output will be written in a stanardized way next to the input data to make sure everyone can access it.
Analysing a custom dataset requires replicating parts of the directory structure and is not the
intended use case for this package.

All the ```r0_to_dl1`` stage job logs are stored ``/fefs/aswg/data/mc/running_analysis/.../job_logs`` and later
moved to ``/fefs/aswg/data/mc/analysis_logs/.../``.

Every time a full MC production is launched, two files with logging information are created:

- ``log_reduced_Prod{3,5}_{PROD_ID}.yml``
- ``log_onsite_mc_r0_to_dl3_Prod{3,5}_{PROD_ID}.yml``

The first one contains a reduced summary of all the scheduled `job ids` (to which particle the job corresponds to),
while the second one contains the same plus all the commands passed to slurm.

Steps explanation
-----------------

The directory structure and the stages to run are determined by the config stages.
After that, the job dependency between stages is done automatically.
    - If the full workflow is launched, directories will not be verified as containing data. Overwriting will only happen when a MC prods sharing the same ``prod_id`` and analysed the same day is run
    - If each step is launched independently (advanced users), no overwriting directory will take place prior confirmation from the user

Real Data analysis
------------------

Real data analysis is not supposed to be supported by these scripts. Use at your own risk.


Pipeline Support
----------------

So far the reference pipeline is ``lstchain`` and only with it a full analysis is possible.
There is however support for ``ctapipe`` and ``hiperta`` as well.
The processing up to dl1 is relatively agnostic of the pipeline; working implementations exist for all of them.

In the case of ``hiperta`` a custom script converts the dl1 output to ``lstchain`` compatible files and the later stages
run using ``lstchain`` scripts.

In the case of ``ctapipe`` dl1 files can be produced using ``ctapipe-stage1``. Once the dependency issues are solved and
ctapipe 0.12 is released, this will most likely switch to using ``ctapipe-process``. We do not have plans to keep supporting older
versions longer than necessary currently.
Because the files are not compatible to ``lstchain`` and there is no support for higher datalevels in ``ctapipe`` yet, it is not possible
to use any of the following stages. This might change in the future.
