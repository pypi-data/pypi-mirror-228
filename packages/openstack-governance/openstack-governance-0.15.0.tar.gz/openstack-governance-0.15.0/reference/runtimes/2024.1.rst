==========================
Tested Runtimes for 2024.1
==========================

At the start of the 2024.1 development cycle, the current :ref:`LTS or stable
distribution <pti-linux-distros>` versions are:

* Ubuntu 22.04
* Debian 12

Additional testing for smooth upgrade
-------------------------------------

* Debian 11 (Supported in previous SLURP release 2023.1)

Best Effort
-----------

This distribution list is the best effort to test them in OpenStack CI/CD. These may not be part of integrated testing and may be tested periodically only.

* CentOS Stream 9
* Rocky Linux 9

Python Runtimes for 2024.1
==========================

It is the :doc:`policy <../../resolutions/20181024-python-update-process>` that
each OpenStack release cycle will target the latest available version of
Python; default Python runtimes on the distributions listed above; and versions
used in integration tests at the start of the cycle, at least until the point
when all projects have migrated to a later version.

Also, as per the Python testing requirements defined in :ref:`pti-python`,
projects should avoid removing Python version that have not reacohed EOL
without a solid reason.

Based on the criteria above, all Python-based projects must target and test
against, at a minimum:

* Python 3.8 (available as default in Ubuntu 20.04)

  Minimal requirement on testing jobs against Python versions above is to
  ensure language compatibility, for example by running unit tests. Having
  more extensive testing is allowed.

* Python 3.9 (available as default in Debian 11)

  In previous cycle testing, we have not seen much incompatible change between
  Python3.8 and Python3.10, it is ok to skip running the Python3.9 testing
  jobs assuming that anything that works on Python 3.8 and 3.10 will also
  work on 3.9.

* Python 3.10 (available as default in Ubuntu 22.04)

* Python 3.11 (available as default in Debian 12)

More details on Python requirements can be found in :ref:`pti-python`.

Node.js Runtime for 2024.1
==========================

Based on the available and supported versions of Node.js (in either our :ref:`LTS or stable
distributions <pti-linux-distros>` or in external source) all JavaScript testing should target:

Ref: https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

* Node.js 18
