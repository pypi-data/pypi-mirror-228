class EventLoop:
    '''Event Loop Object

    Represent all Event Loop settings and necessary references.

    An event loop is basically a big :code-python:`while True:` loop. The tasks
    to process are `ELReq` objects, and that processing produces a stream of
    responses.

    There are two kinds of responses:

    - A "signal", index is `None`, payload is `bool`.
        This signals the Event Loop started or stopped task processing.
    - A "response", index is `int`, payload is `ELRes`.
        The index indicates the count of the current processing task.

    Internally uses the :py:mod:`threading` functions. This means the threading
    model is cooperative, that is, the task processing functions must yield
    their time, not hog the processing time for themselves.

    The event loop itself is single-threaded, meaning there's only at most a
    single task is being executed.

    You can choose between two different response parsing behaviours, depending
    on the arguments you give:

    - ``qoutput``: Define the response output as a queue, possibly given from outside.
    - ``wcallback``: Define some a ``Tk`` callback function to be called.
        Even though ``Tk`` is not thread-safe, some specific functions are, and
        this is used to "merge" the event process loop with the existing ``Tk``
        event loop. See `ELCallback` for more information on how those
        functions are defined.

    Note that ``qoutput`` is the default, when you do not choose one or the
    other.

    Avoid using `time.sleep` directly when implementing the tasks. Use
    `isleep`/`usleep` for precise control over interruptible behaviour.

    Args:
        qinput: `Queue <queue.Queue>` with `ELReq` to consume.
            Optional, created a new queue when not given.
        qoutput: `Queue <queue.Queue>` with `ELRes` to produce.
            Optional, created a new queue when not given.
            See above for the interaction with ``wcallback``.
        wcallback: `Callback Configuration <ELCallback>` object.
            Optional.
            See above for the interaction with ``qoutput``.

    All other keyword arguments are passed to the `setup_eventloop` function.

    .. note::
        This object should be created on the Main Thread, not from any
        sub-thread.
        This is enforced on debug mode.

    .. note::
        In case ``qoutput`` is chosen, the main ``Tk`` processing loop for
        `responses <ELRes>` must implement something like this, using an `Interval
        <tkmilan.model.Interval>`:
