The following pages contain examples of visual elements that can be included in Sphinx docs. The goals of this section are:

 * To show how these elements look like when using Nefertiti for Sphinx,
 * to help with the development of the theme itself, and
 * to serve as a reminder of how to include these elements in reStructuredText and Markdown documents.
