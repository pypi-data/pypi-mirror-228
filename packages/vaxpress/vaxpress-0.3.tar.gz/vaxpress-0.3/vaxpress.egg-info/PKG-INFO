# VaxPress

VaxPress is a codon optimizer platform tailored for mRNA vaccine
development. It refines coding sequences starting from protein or
RNA sequences to boost both storage stability and *in vivo* protein
expression. Plus, additional properties can be easily programmed
into the optimization process with just a few lines of code via a
pluggable interface. For the detailed information about VaxPress,
including its options and algorithmic features, please refer to the
[VaxPress documentation page](https://link.to/page).

# Installation

### pip

You can install VaxPress via pip:

```bash
# To install using pip
pip install vaxpress

# To install using pip with LinearFold (only for non-commercial uses)
pip install 'vaxpress[nonfree]'

# To install from the GitHub
git clone https://github.com/ChangLabSNU/VaxPress.git
cd VaxPress
pip install .
```

### Conda

Alternatively, you may also install VaxPress via a conda package:

```bash
conda install -c changlabsnu -c bioconda -c conda-forge vaxpress
```

### Singularity

First, you will need to install [Singularity CE](https://sylabs.io/singularity/).
Once Singularity is installed, you can download the VaxPress image from this
GitHub repository and run using the following command:

```bash
singularity vaxpress.sif ...
```

# Usage

## Quick Start

Here's a basic command-line instruction to start using VaxPress.
Note that `-i` and `-o` options are mandatory:

```bash
vaxpress -i {path_to_input.fa} -o {path_to_output_directory} --iterations {n_iterations} -p {n_processes}
```

### Input

Provide a CDS sequence in FASTA format. Alternatively, if you have
a protein sequence in FASTA format, use the `--protein` option.

### Number of Iterations

By default, the `--iterations` option is set to 10.  For a comprehensive
optimization, it's suggested to use a minimum of 500 iterations.
However, the ideal number of iterations can vary based on the input's
length, composition, and chosen optimization settings. Note that
the optimization process might halt before completing all specified
iterations if no improvement is detected over several consecutive
cycles.

### Multi-Core Support

You can use multiple CPU cores for optimization with the `-p` or
`--processes` option.

## Adjusting the Fitness Scoring Scheme

VaxPress optimizes synonymous codon selections to potentially enhance
the fitness of coding sequences for mRNA vaccines. This fitness is
derived from a cumulative score of various metrics, including the
codon adaptation index, GC ratio, among others. To emphasize or
de-emphasize a specific feature, simply adjust its weight. A deeper
understanding of the scoring functions' principles is available on
the [optimization algorithm page](#algorithm_page).

### Setting Weights

To fine-tune the optimization, adjust the weights of individual
scoring functions using the `--{func}-weight` option. Setting a
function's weight to `0` effectively disables it.

```bash
# Concentrate on the stable secondary structure (more weight to the MFE)
vaxpress -i spike.fa -o result-spike --mfe-weights 10

# Turn off the consideration of repeated sequences
vaxpress -i spike.fa -o result-spike --repeats-weight 0
```

### Custom Scoring Functions

VaxPress allows users to add their custom scoring functions. This
feature enables a more targeted optimization process by integrating
new sequence attributes of interest. For detailed instructions,
please refer to the [Adding a scoring function page](#scoring_func).

## Using LinearDesign for Optimization Initialization

[LinearDesign](https://github.com/LinearDesignSoftware/LinearDesign)
(Zhang *et al.,* 2023) offers ultra-fast optimization, focusing on
near-optimal MFE and CAI values. By using the `--lineardesign`
option, VaxPress invokes LinearDesign internally then begins its
optimization with a sequence already refined by LinearDesign.
Subsequent VaxPress optimizations further improves the sequences
for features like secondary structures near the start codon, uridine
count, in-cell stability, tandem repeats, and local GC content.

To utilize the LinearDesign integration, provide the path to the
installed directory of LinearDesign using the `--lineardesign-dir`
option. This option can be omitted in subsequent uses. The
`--lineardesign` option also needs a LAMBDA parameter, which influences
the balance between MFE and CAI. Values between 0.5 and 4 are usually
suitable starting points. For insights into the LAMBDA value's
implications, consult Zhang *et al.* (2023).

Note that sequences straight from LinearDesign often have suboptimal
structures around the start codon. Under the high mutation rate at
the beginning, this causes the main sequence body to lose its optimal
MFE structure. The `-â€”conservative-start` option tackles this by
focusing on the start codon region before optimizing the rest. Also,
given that LinearDesign's outputs are already quite optimal, the
`--initial-mutation-rate` can be reduced to 0.01.  This ensures
efficient optimization as there's a minimal likelihood that a better
mutation would emerge with a higher mutation rate.

```bash
# Running VaxPress with LinearDesign
vaxpress -i spike.fa -o results-spike --processes 36 \
         --iterations 500 --lineardesign 1.0 \
         --lineardesign-dir /path/to/LinearDesign \
         --conservative-start 10 --initial-mutation-rate 0.01
```

## Output

Once you've run VaxPress, the specified output directory will contain
the following five files:

- ``report.html``: A summary report detailing the result and
  optimization process.
- ``best-sequence.fasta``: The refined coding sequence.
- ``checkpoints.tsv``: The best sequences and the evaluation results
  at each iteration.
- ``log.txt``: Contains the logs that were displayed in the console.
- ``parameters.json``: Contains the parameters employed for the optimization.
  This file can be feeded to VaxPress with the `--preset` option to duplicate
  the set-up for other sequence.
