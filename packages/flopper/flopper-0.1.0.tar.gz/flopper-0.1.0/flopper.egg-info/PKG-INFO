An enhanced FLOP counter based on fvcore with additional support to custom modules and simplified API
This tool is a lightweight wrapper around [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore) flop counter, which is a PyTorch based FLOP counter. It supports counting FLOPs for custom modules and provides a simplified API.
