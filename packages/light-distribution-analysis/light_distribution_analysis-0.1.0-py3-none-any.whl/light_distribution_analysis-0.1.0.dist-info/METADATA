# Light-Distribution-Analysis

## Overview

Light-Distribution-Analysis is a Python package that enables you to analyze the flux of images based on their wavelength and frequency. By utilizing OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, this package provides a simple yet effective way to process and save images as well as calculate flux values.

## Features

- Convert RGB images to wavelength and frequency representations.
- Calculate the flux of images in terms of both wavelength and frequency.
- Save processed images and flux values.
- Export flux data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

To install Light-Distribution-Analysis, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install light-distribution-analysis
