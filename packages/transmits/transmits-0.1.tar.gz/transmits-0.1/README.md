# Transmit

Transmit is a revolutionary Python package that allows you to transmit data of any type, to any location, and receive it at any location. It provides a simple and efficient way to share data across different parts of your application without any hassle.

## Features

- **No Type Limitations**: Transmit and receive data of any type without any limitations or restrictions.

## Installation

Installing Transmit is as easy as running a single command. 
You can install Transmit from PyPI:
pip install transmits


## Usage

Using Transmit is incredibly simple. Here is a basic example:

```python
from transmits import transmit

biu = transmit()
biu.to.data1 = 5
print(biu.me.data1)

In this example, we first import the Transmit class from the transmit package. Then, we create an instance of the Transmit class, and assign a value to biu.to.data1. We can then retrieve this value from biu.me.data1.

The Transmit class allows us to send and receive data anywhere in our application, regardless of the type of data.
