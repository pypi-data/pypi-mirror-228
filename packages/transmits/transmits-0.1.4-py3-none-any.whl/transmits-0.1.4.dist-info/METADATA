# Transmit

Transmit is a revolutionary Python package that allows you to transmit data of any type, to any location, and receive it at any location. It provides a simple and efficient way to share data across different parts of your application without any hassle.

## Features

- **Send Data Anywhere**: Transmit data of any type to any part of your application.
- **Receive Data Anywhere**: Receive the transmitted data at any location in your application.
- **No Type Limitations**: Transmit and receive data of any type without any limitations or restrictions.

## Installation

Installing Transmit is as easy as running a single command. 
You can install Transmit from PyPI:
pip install transmits


## Usage

Using Transmit is incredibly simple. Here is a basic example:

```python
from transmits import Transmit

biu = Transmit()
my_dict = {}  
biu.to.data1 = my_dict  
# other code in anywhere
your_dict = biu.me.data1 
print(your_dict)
```

In this example, we first import the Transmit class from the transmit package. Then, we create an instance of the Transmit class called biu, and assign a value to biu.to.data1. We can then retrieve this value from biu.me.data1.

The Transmit class allows us to send and receive data anywhere in our application,regardless of the type of data.
