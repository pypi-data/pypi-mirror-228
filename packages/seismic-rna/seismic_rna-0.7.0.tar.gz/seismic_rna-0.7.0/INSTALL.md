# Installing SEISMIC-RNA

SEISMIC-RNA can be installed in any of the following ways.


## Important: Before you install

You will spare yourself much frustration by creating a virtual environment for
SEISMIC-RNA before installing it. For instructions on creating and using a
virtual environment, please see `VENV.md`.


## Install with `pip` (recommended)

### Fresh installation with `pip`

If SEISMIC-RNA is not currently installed on your system (or in your virual
environment, if you are using one), then install it with this `pip` command:

`pip install seismic-rna`


### Install the latest version with `pip`

If a version of SEISMIC-RNA is already installed but a newer version has been
released, then update it with this `pip` command:

`pip install --upgrade seismic-rna`


### Install a specific version with `pip`

To install a specific version of SEISMIC-RNA with `pip`, add the version number
after `seismic-rna` and two `=` signs. For example, to install a hypothetical
version `1.2.3`, run this command:

`pip install seismic-rna==1.2.3`


## Install with `conda`

SEISMIC-RNA is not yet available through `conda` but will be soon.
