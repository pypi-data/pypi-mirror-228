Clustering

## About

SEISMIC-RNA analyzes deep sequencing datasets from RNA mutational profiling
experiments, such as [DMS-MaPseq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4057)
and [SHAPE-MaP](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3029).
This software introduces an optimized implementation of the original algorithm
[DREEM](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2253-5) for quantifying and
clustering mutations to infer RNA structural ensembles.
