# Gradescope Mean

A utility which computes final grades (example: [grade_full.csv](doc/grade_full.csv)) from gradescope outputs. It allows the instructor to ...

- weight assignments per category
    - e.g. all HW assignments are 50% of grade
- waive lowest N assignments per category
    - e.g. 2 lowest HW assignments, per student, are waived
- apply a late penalty (per day) that assignments are submitted beyond
  deadline
    - e.g. HW is penalized 15% of average assignment hw weight for every day late it is submitted 
    - also includes support for not penalizing the first N "late days" per assignment category (e.g. each student may use up to 3 "late days" across all HWs without penalty)
- waive assignments per individual student
- waive late penalties per individual student's assignment
- validate gradescope student list by passing an email list of active students
    - e.g. one student has a low average grade, have they dropped the course?
- exclude assignments which shouldn't be included in final grade
    - assignments automatically excluded if they don't have some minimum completion threshold
- substitute one assignment in place of another (where substitute has
  higher percentage)
    - e.g. to "merge" two versions of the quiz with their own unique gradescope assignment
        1. substitute `quiz_02` for `quiz_01`
        2. exclude `quiz_02`

# Installation

    pip3 install gradescope-mean

# Usage

Download all gradescope assignments to some local `scope.csv` file
(`Assignments > Download Grades > Download CSV`) and run:

    python -m gradescope_mean scope.csv

to create output [grade_full.csv](doc/grade_full.csv) using default configuartion.
This first run will have created a `config.yaml` configuration file which you can modify to take advantage of the functionality listed above (details given in the [configuration doc](doc/config.md)).
To re-run with your configuration options:

    python -m gradescope_mean scope.csv --config config.yaml

## Other outputs

- Provide an output file via `--late_csv` to observe late days per student-assignment pair.

- Provide the `--per_student` flag to create a folder of student-specific csvs, helpful for emailing students the particulars of their grades.

- Pass the `--plot` flag above to view histograms ([hist.html](doc/hist.html)) per assignment category:

<img alt="histogram per category" src="doc/hist.png" width="800px"/>

# Exporting Grades

The interface above yields a "grade_full.csv" which can be processed so its ready to import into [canvas](doc/upload_canvas.md) or [Northeastern's Banner](doc/upload_banner.md), see links for detail.
