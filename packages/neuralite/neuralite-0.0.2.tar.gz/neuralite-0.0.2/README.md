## Getting Started
To get started, install Neuralite with pip:
```bash
pip install Neuralite
```

## Basic Chatbot
Creating a basic chatbot is simple:
```python
from neuralite.interpreter import ai # Imports framework

assistant = ai('dataset.json') # Loads dataset

cycle_end = False # Starts the AI cycle

while not cycle_end: # Main cycle
    message = input("Enter a message: ") # Prompts user with message
    if message.lower() == "stop": # Exit with 'stop'
        cycle_end = True # Ends cycle
    else:
        print(assistant.process_input(message)) # Prints the response
```

# Compiling Your Model ðŸ“¦
To make your dataset unreadable, load faster, and to package it into a neat file.

```python
from neuralite.interpreter import ai # Imports framework

assistant = ai('dataset.json') # Loads dataset

assistant.compile('model.nlite') # Packages dataset to 'model.nlite'
```

# Loading a Compiled Model ðŸ”“
To load a precompiled model.

```python
from neuralite.interpreter import ai # Imports framework

assistant = ai.compiled('model.nlite') # Loads the compiled model

cycle_end = False # Starts the AI cycle

while not cycle_end: # Main cycle
    message = input("Enter a message: ") # Prompts user with message
    if message.lower() == "stop": # Exit with 'stop'
        cycle_end = True # Ends cycle
    else:
        print(assistant.process_input(message)) # Prints the response
```
