## Example Code

**Uploading a file to a resource located in a subproject:**
```python
import coscine
from datetime import datetime

token: str = "My Coscine API Token"
client = coscine.Client(token)
project = client.project("My Project").subproject("My Subproject")
resource = project.resource("My Resource")
metadata = resource.metadata_form()
metadata["Author"] = "Dr. Akula"
metadata["Created"] = datetime.now()
metadata["Discipline"] = "Medicine"
metadata["DAP"] = 0.32
# ...
resource.upload("file.txt", "C:/databases/file.txt", metadata)
```

**Listing all files in all resources of a project:**
```python
import coscine

token: str = "My Coscine API Token"
client = coscine.Client(token)
for resource in client.project("My Project").resources():
	for file in resource.contents():
		if not file.is_folder:
			print(file.path)
```
