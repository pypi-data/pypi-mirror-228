Welcome to Fabric!
==================

Fabric is a high level Python (2.7, 3.4+) library designed to execute shell
commands remotely over SSH, yielding useful Python objects in return. It builds
on top of `Invoke <https://pyinvoke.org>`_ (subprocess command execution and
command-line features) and `Paramiko <https://paramiko.org>`_ (SSH protocol
implementation), extending their APIs to complement one another and provide
additional functionality.

To find out what's new in this version of Fabric, please see `the changelog
<https://fabfile.org/changelog.html#{}>`_.

The project maintainer keeps a `roadmap
<https://bitprophet.org/projects#roadmap>`_ on his website.
