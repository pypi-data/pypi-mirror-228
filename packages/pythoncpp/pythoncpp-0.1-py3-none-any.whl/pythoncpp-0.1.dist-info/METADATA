# Welcome to PythonC++!

PythonC++ is a full-scale compiler for Python.

The aim of this project is to convert high-level Python code to lower-level C++ code, increasing your program's performance dramatically.

In theory, PythonC++ is faster than other tools (such as PyInstaller), as it leaves no trace of a Python runtime interpreter, or libraries.

The output is just plain C++ code - without any Python - so your program runs at the maximum performance!

Thanks for choosing PythonC++ to simplify your projects!
