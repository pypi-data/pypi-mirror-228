# Stackler

Working with Phabricator Stack has never been so easy.

```
$ stackler submit -m "rebase msg"
By continuing, this script will:
Update D157389 with [24a42cd9 1/3 Add Framework], message: rebase msg.
Update D157390 with [67cfa09f 2/3 Add UI], message: rebase msg.
Submit [7bc9760d 3/3 Add API] based on [67cfa09f 2/3 Add the UI framework fo...].
```

* Display the working stack
* Submit/Update all the commits into a Phabricator Stack
* Wrap around `git rebase <sha>^` to allow easy mid-stack edit

# Install

## With [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)
```
# get pipx, which runs a pip command easily
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# use pipx to install stackler
pipx install stackler
```

## Manual Install
```
# install from pip
pip3 install --user stackler
```

If your path isn't setup to work with pip already, as in if you see 
> WARNING: The script stackler is installed in `<pip-path>` which is not on PATH.

You need to add the pip executable path to your `$PATH`. Here are some examples:

* bash
  
  ```
  echo -n 'PATH="$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

* zsh
  
  ```
  echo -n 'PATH="$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc
  ```
