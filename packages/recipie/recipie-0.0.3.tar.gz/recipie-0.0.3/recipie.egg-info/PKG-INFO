# Recipie

Python idoms and recipes

# Submodule

Some recipie modules having the same name with standard libraries are meant
as a drop in replacement for their counter parts. For example:

```
# Replace contextlib by recipie.contextlib

#from contextlib import *
from recipie.contextlib import *

# All standard contextlib and recipie.contextlib extensions are available
```

## contextlib

### cleanup(func, *args, **kwargs) [0.0.3]

Executes a clean up task on exiting context. The clean up task can be canceled.

Example:

```
with cleanup(undo, arg) as cleanup_task:
    result = action()
    if result:
        cleanup_task.cancel()
```

### commit(func, *args, **kwargs) [0.0.1]

Executes *func* if the code ran to completion without any error:

Example:

```
def save_data(data):
    ...

with commit(save_data, data):
    # other actions
    ...

    # save_data is called if there is no error
```

* Also see ***rollback***

### rollback(func, *args, **kwargs) [0.0.1]

Executes *func* if when encouter error

Example:

```
def undo(data):
    ...

with rollback(undo, data):
    # Other actions
    ...
```

* Also see ***commit

### Buffer [0.0.2]

Accumulates data into a buffer to be processed when the buffer is full.

Example:

```
def save_data(data: list[int]):
    ...

with Buffer(1000, save_data) as buffer:
    for i in range(1500):
        buffer.add(i)
        # On 1001th item, called save_data to save previous 1000 items
# When out of context, call save_data on the last 500 items
```

## functools

### @scoped [0.0.2]

*"Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"*


Decorates a function to make it part of another namespace


Examples:

```
def retry():
    ...

# Put no_delay under "retry" so it can only be refered to as retry.no_delay
@scoped(retry)
def no_delay():
    ...
```

### @default_on_error(value, errors) [0.0.1]

Decorates a function to return the specified *value* if *errors* is raised.

*value*: Default value to return on error

*errors*: Error or tuple of errors to check for

Example:

```
@default_on_error(None, KeyError)
def get_from_dict(dict_, key):
    return dict_[key] # Possible KeyError

value = get_from_dict(d, "Test") # Value is None when "Test" is not in d

```

### @skip_on_error(errors) [0.0.1]

Decorates a function to return None if *errors* is raised (equivalent to @default_on_error(None, errors)

### @retry(tries, errors, error_filter, delay_gen, log_error) [0.0.1]

Retries function *tries* times if encounter an error that matches errors and error_filter

*tries*: Number of attempts on the function. Must be at least 2

*errors*: exception or tuple of exception to retry

*error_filter*: function that takes in an error and returns
**True** if it is a retriable error

*delay_gen*: Delay generator that produce an iterator of delay values for
use between attempts.
Example:

```
@retry(3, NetworkError) # Retry 3 times on NetworkError)
def get_db_connection():
   ...

conn = get_db_connection() # Automatically retry on network error
```

* Either *errors* or *error_filter* must be specified

#### Predefined delay policies:

1. **retry.no_delay**: No delay between attempts. This is picked up when no delay policy specified.
   It is equivalent to *retry.const_delay(0)*.

2. **retry.const_delay(delay)**: Delay in seconds as specified by *delay*

3. **retry.expo_backoff(base, cap, jitter)**: exponential backoff delay. With no jitter, values
are *max(base * 2 ^ n*, cap).
   
    * *retry.no_jitter*: (default) actual delay is fixed at the calculated value
    * *retry.half_jitter*: actual delay is randomly picked from [value/2, value)
    * *retry.full_jitter*: actual delay is randomly picked from [0, value)
