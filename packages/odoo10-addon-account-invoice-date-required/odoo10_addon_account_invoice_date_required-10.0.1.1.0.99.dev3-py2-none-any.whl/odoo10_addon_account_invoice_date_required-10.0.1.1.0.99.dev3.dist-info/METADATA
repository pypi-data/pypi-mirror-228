In Odoo, when you validate an invoice with a void invoice date, it is
automatically filled in with current date (today).

The invoice validation is now restricted if the invoice date is not filled in.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
