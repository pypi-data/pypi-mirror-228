Reaction Network (`rxn_network`) is a Python package for predicting likely inorganic
chemical reaction pathways using combinatorial and graph theoretical methods.

## Installation

We recommend installing using pip:

```properties
pip install -U reaction-network
```

The package will then be installed under the name `rxn_network`. The Materials Project
API is not installed by default; to install it, run: `pip install -U mp-api`.

> **Note**
> As of version 7.0 and beyond, the `reaction-network` package no longer uses `graph-tool`. All network functionality is now implemented using `rustworkx`. This means it is no longer required to complete any extra installations.

## Tutorials

The `examples` folder contains two (2) demonstration notebooks:

- **1_enumerators.ipynb**: how to enumerate reactions from a set of entries; running
  enumerators using jobflow
- **2_networks.ipynb**: how to build reaction networks from a list of enumerators and
  entries; how to perform pathfinding to recommend balanced reaction pathways; running
  reaction network analysis using jobflow
