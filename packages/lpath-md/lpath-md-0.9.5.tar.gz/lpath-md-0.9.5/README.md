### TODO
- [x] EXTRACT step only does WE right now, need to extend to plain MD (i.e. a states.npy)
- [x] Usage.rst page
- [x] example ipynbs are bare bones, need sample files
- [x] unit testing
- [x] extract defaults to last frame of iteration. Implement stride and actually give pcoord/auxdata to correct frame.
- [x] command line interface/argparser
- [x] Sphinx/Read the Docs autodoc
- [x] Run each tool directly
- [x] Rename Repo
