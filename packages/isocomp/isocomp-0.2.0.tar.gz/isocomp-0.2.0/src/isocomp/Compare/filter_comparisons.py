    Args:
        comparison_list (list): This function is intended to be used in 
            find_unique_isoforms(), which creates a list of dict objects by 
            iterating over the clusters and storing the result of 
            compare_isoforms_incluster() in a list. This argument takes that 
            list of dict objects 
        min_quantile (float, optional): Only accept 
            isoforms which are less than the min_quantile of the normalized 
            edit distance similar to one another. Defaults to 0.05.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A filtered dataframe with the columns corresponding 
                      to the fields recorded in find_unique_isoforms()
