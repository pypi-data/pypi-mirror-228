    An object containing a single data point for a specific aggregate, data
    signal and interval.

    Attributes:
        aggregate (AggregateModeEnum): How data is aggregated in the asset
            structure.
        aggregate_id (int): The id of this aggregate group: device id, site
            id, or the constant -1 for portfolio. For `siteLevel` aggregation
            a generated unique id is used.
        aggregate_path_names (list of string): For `siteLevel` aggregation
            this contains the title for each level in the hierarchy. For other
            types of aggregation it will be empty.
        device_ids (list of int): The ids of the devices in this aggregate
            group.
        calculation (CalculationModeRealTimeEnum): Which operation to use when
            aggregating data.
        data_signal (DataSignal): A data signal.
        data (dict<object, float>): A single key value pair with timestamp as
            key and the data measurement as value. The timestamps are in UTC.
