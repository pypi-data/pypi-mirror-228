# pawnhub


Retrieve results of your online chess games from lichess.org and
chess.com.

Instantly see how you negotiated first moves to reach your favourite
positions. Spot which lines are your kryptonite leading to a
dry/deceiving middle game.

Behind the scenes, it exploits
[pawnstore](https://github.com/Kraymer/pawnstore) library to fetch games
into a local database then make them
[rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
