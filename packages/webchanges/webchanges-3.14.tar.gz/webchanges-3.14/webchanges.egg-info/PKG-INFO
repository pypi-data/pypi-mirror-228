======================
webchanges |downloads|
======================

**webchanges** checks web content and notifies you via e-mail (or one of many other supported services) if a change is
detected. **webchanges** can also check the output of local commands. The notification includes the changed URL or
command and a summary (diff) of what has changed.

**webchanges** *anonymously* alerts you of web changes.



Requirements
============
**webchanges** requires |support|.

You should use the latest version of `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ if possible, but older
Python versions are supported for 3 years after being obsoleted by a new major release (3.x). For each major release,
only the latest bug and security fix version (3.x.y) is supported.


Installation
============
Install **webchanges** |pypi_version| |format| |status| |security| with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install webchanges


Documentation
=============
The documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/>`__ |readthedocs|.


Quick Start
============
Initialize
----------

#. Run the following command to create the default ``config.yaml`` (configuration) and ``jobs.yaml`` (jobs) files and
   open an editor to add your `jobs <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jobs.html>`__:

   .. code-block:: bash

      webchanges --edit


#. Run the following command to change the default `configuration
   <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html>`__, e.g. to receive change notifications
   ("`reports <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reporters.html>`__")
   by `e-mail <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reporters.html#smtp>`__ and/or one of many other methods:

   .. code-block:: bash

      webchanges --edit-config


Run
---
To check the sources in your jobs and report on (e.g. display or via e-mail) any changes found from the previous
execution, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   webchanges

**webchanges** does not include a scheduler. We recommend using a system scheduler to automatically run **webchanges**
periodically:

- On Linux or macOS, you can use cron (if you have never used cron before, see
  `here <https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm>`__); `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru>`__ will build a
  schedule expression for you.
- On Windows, you can use the built-in `Windows Task Scheduler
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler>`__.

Contributing
============
We welcome any contribution no matter how small as both pull requests and `issue reports
<https://github.com/mborsetti/webchanges/issues>`__.

More information for developers and documentation contributors is `here

Compatibility with **urlwatch**
================================

This project is based on `urlwatch <https://github.com/thp/urlwatch>`__ 2.21. You can easily upgrade from
**urlwatch** 2.28 (see `here <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migration.html>`__) using the same job and
configuration files and benefit from many HTML-focused improvements, including:

* Report links that are `clickable <https://pypi.org/project/webchanges/>`__!
* Original formatting such as **bolding / headers**, *italics*, :underline:`underlining`, list bullets (â€¢) and
  indentation;
* :additions:`Added` and :deletions:`deleted` lines clearly highlighted by color and strikethrough, and long lines that
  wrap around;
* Correct rendering by email clients who override stylesheets (e.g. Gmail);
* Other legibility improvements;
* Use of stable Playwright instead of buggy Pyppeteer for websites that need JavaScript rendering before capture,
  increasing stability, reliability, flexibility and control;
* New filters such as `additions_only <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/diff_filters.html#additions-only>`__,
  which makes it easier to track content that was added without the distractions of the content that was deleted;
* Much better `documentation <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/>`__;
* More reliability and stability, including a 39 percentage point increase in testing coverage to 81%;
* Many other additions, refinements and fixes (see `detailed information
  <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/migration.html#upgrade-details>`__).
