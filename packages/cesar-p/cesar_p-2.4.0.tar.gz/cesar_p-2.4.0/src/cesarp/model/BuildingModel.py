    Version 1.0: first version pushed to master
    Version 1.1: added year_of_construction, cooling parameters
    Version 1.2: merged Version 1.1 from feature/cooling branch, but without cooling parameters, but adding bldg_type
    Verstion 1.3: changed BldgShapeEnvelope and BldgShapeDetailed from typed dict to dataclasses
    Version 1.4: adding night ventilation and shading to bldg operation and construction
    Version 1.5: changing BuildingOperation to BuildingOperationMapping to allow for per-floor BuildingOperation assignment
    Version 1.6: adding name parameter to BuildingOperation
    Version 1.7: removing internal floor from construction, as it must be mirrored construction to internal ceiling
