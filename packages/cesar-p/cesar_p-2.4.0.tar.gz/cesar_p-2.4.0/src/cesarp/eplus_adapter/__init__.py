eplus_adapter
============================

Responsible for everything regarding EnergyPlus, from IDF creation to result extraction.
The implementation is based on the eppy library, see https://pypi.org/project/eppy/

For custom IDF creation, create an instance of IDF (with eppy) and call the methods writing the parts of the IDF you want, either
use the functions in CesarIDFWriter or call directly methods form idf_writer_xxx.

Main API

class / module                                                                          description
======================================================================================= ===========================================================
:py:class:`cesarp.eplus_adapter.CesarIDFWriter`                                         creates an IDF file based on :py:class:`cesarp.model.BuildingModel`
                                                                                        connection according to the configuration (by default local file)

:py:mod:`cesarp.eplus_adapter.eplus_sim_runner`                                         run energyplus simulation for exisitng IDF file

:py:mod:`cesarp.eplus_adapter.eplus_eso_results_handling`                               extracts main results from EnergyPlus eso results file

:py:class:`cesarp.eplus_adapter.EPlusEioResultAnalyzer`                                 extracts results from EnergyPlus eio results file, e.g. floor area

:py:mod:`cesarp.eplus_adapter.eplus_error_file_handling`                                extract error level from EnergyPlus err log file
