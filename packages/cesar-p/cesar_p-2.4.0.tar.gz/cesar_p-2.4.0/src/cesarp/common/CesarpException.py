class CesarpException(Exception):
    """
    For a proper Exception handling concept, actually within the code from cesarp package only this CesarpException should be raised
    instead of the Exception directly.
    This allows the caller to except a CesarpException and do another error handling then when a plain Exception is thrown.
    It also makes it clear to the user of the library when an exception is kind of expected and when it just crashed somewhere.
