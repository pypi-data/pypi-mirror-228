SIA2024
============

Package providing functionality for creating operational parameters and profiles based on SIA2024.
As the raw SIA2024 data used as an input cannot be released OpenSource, there are pre-generated profiles included.
The code for generating new profiles is included as well, as it might be useful to know how the profiles are built up
or reuse part of it in case you want to use another data source to generate your profiles.

The SIA2024 data is stored at UES Lab/Empa as a separate GIT project.


The classes/modules built to be used from outside (API of package):
