This module includes functions to define neighbouring and adjacent buildings.
A building is represented as a DataFrame row or pd.Series with following entries:
* 'bld_id' - unique id
* 'gis_fid' - id as assigned by external gis program
* 'height' - height of building in meter
* 'footprint_shape' - footprint of building as a pandas.DataFrame[columns=[x,y]] defining the corner vertices of the building, coordinates in meter
