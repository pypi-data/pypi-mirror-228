graphdb_access
============================

Interface to the information stored in the graph database. The data can be either locally in a TTL file (included under ressources) or queried
from a database running on a GraphDB Server (or locally on your machine).

If you use a remote GraphDB, you are responsible to save or track the data used in your project, as in a common database it could be overwritten or corrected
which means after some time you wont be able to reproduce the exact same results when querying data from the same remote DB.

The package is not a strict data access, as there is some business logic included.
