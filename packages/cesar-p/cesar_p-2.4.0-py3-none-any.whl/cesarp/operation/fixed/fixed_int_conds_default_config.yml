OPERATION:
  # Parameters when using the FixedBuildingOperationFactory (same parameters and profiles for all buildings)
  # To enable FIXED operation parameters set config MANAGER -  BUILDING_OPERATION_FACTORY_CLASS to 
  # "cesarp.operation.fixed.FixedBuildingOperationFactory.FixedBuildingOperationFactory"
  # parameters starting with SCHED_ should point to a file with a yearly profile (without header, only one column)
  # parameters with suffix _PER_ZONE_AREA relate to m2 of floor area
