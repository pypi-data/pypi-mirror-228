OPERATION:
  # Parameters for night ventilation, same parameters for all buildings are used 
  # (see PassiveCoolingOperationFactory, which is used by FixedBuildingOperationFactory as well as SIA2024Facade)
  # If ACTIVE is False, no night ventilation is applied at all
  NIGHT_VENTILATION:
    ACTIVE: FALSE
    flow_rate: 2.5 ACH             # night ventilation nominal air flow rate - in air-changes-per-hour (ACH)
    min_indoor_temperature: 24 °C  # minimum indoor temperature for the space to require cooling (C) - above this value the window can be opened
    maximum_in_out_deltaT: 2 °C    # maximum indoor-outdoor temperature differential in (C) to ensure that the occupant only opens the window when the ambient can provide cooling, i.e., when the outdoor temperature is lower than the inside temperature by a given number of degrees
    max_wind_speed: 40 m/s         # maximum wind speed threshold (m/s) - above this value the occupant closes the window - 40m/s is default in EnergyPlus Version 8.5
    start_hour: "20:00"            # night ventilation starting hour (00:00 format)
    end_hour: "6:00"               # night ventilation ending hour (00:00 format)
  # Parameters for operational properties of window shading, same parameters for all buildings are used.
  # (see PassiveCoolingOperationFactory, which is used by FixedBuildingOperationFactory as well as SIA2024Facade)
  # For window shade material properties, see :py:class:`cesarp.construction.ConstructionBasics.ConstructionBasics` method get_window_shading_constr
  # If ACTIVE is True and a :py:class:`cesarp.model.WindowConstruction.WindowShadingMaterial` material 
  # with is_shading_available True is set in the constructional part of the BuildingModel, WindowShading is applied,
  # if one of those conditions is False, no window shading is applied
  WINDOW_SHADING_CONTROL:
    ACTIVE: True
    is_exterior: True  # type of shading device [False-interior True-exterior]
    rad_min_set: 90 W/m2   # minimum radiation set point 
    shading_control_type: OnIfHighSolarOnWindow  # note that When changeing to not solar based, you have to adapt code to handle the Setpoint when writing the IDF correctly
