energy_strategy
============================

There are two energy strategies implemented, business as usual (WWB) and New Energy Policy (NEP). You can switch between
them by setting the configuration parameter ENERGY_STRATEGY_SELECTION (default is WWB).

The package handles data access for the two strategies, but has no buisness logic implemented.

The input files are all Excel files, as there are quite many files and they did exist already, the format was not changed to YAML or CSV.
Data seems also to be fairly stable, if changes occure more frequent you could think of changing the data format. If you do so, just keep
the interface of the classes as it is now, so that the other packages accessing data do not need to be changed.

The energy strategy is used in two places:

- For operational emissions and costs :py:class:`cesarp.emissions_costs.OperationalEmissionsAndCosts`
- For defining which buildings should be retrofitted (retrofit rates) :py:class:`cesarp.retrofit.energy_strategy_2050.EnergyPerspective2050BldgElementsRetrofitter`

:py:class:`cesarp.energy_strategy.EnergyMix`                                            query data about the energy mix data, e.g. wood mix, gas mix etc

:py:class:`cesarp.energy_strategy.FuelCosts`                                            query fuel cost data

:py:class:`cesarp.energy_strategy.SystemEfficiencies`                                   query efficiency of system installations (for dhw, heating)

:py:class:`cesarp.energy_strategy.RetrofitRates`                                        query retrofit rates
