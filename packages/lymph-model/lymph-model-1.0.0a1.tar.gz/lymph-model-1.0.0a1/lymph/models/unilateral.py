    It does this by representing it as a directed graph (DAG), which is stored in and
    managed by the attribute :py:attr:`~graph`. The progression itself can be modelled
    via hidden Markov models (HMM) or Bayesian networks (BN). In both cases, instances

        The ``graph_dict`` that represents the lymphatic system should given as a
        dictionary. Its keys are tuples of the form ``("tumor", "<tumor_name>")`` or
        ``("lnl", "<lnl_name>")``. The values are lists of strings that represent the
        names of the nodes that are connected to the node given by the key.

        Note:
            Do make sure the values in the dictionary are of type ``list`` and *not*
            ``set``. Sets do not preserve the order of the elements and thus the order
            of the edges in the graph. This may lead to inconsistencies in the model.

        For example, the following graph represents a lymphatic system with one tumors
        and three lymph node levels:

        .. code-block:: python

            graph = {
                ("tumor", "T"): ["II", "III", "IV"],

                ("lnl", "IV"): [],
            }

        The ``tumor_state`` is the initial (and unchangeable) state of the tumor.
        Typically, this can be omitted and is then set to be the maximum of the
        ``allowed_states``, which is the states the LNLs can take on. The default is a
        binary representation with ``allowed_states=[0, 1]``. For this, one can also
        use the classmethod :py:meth:`~Unilateral.binary`. For a trinary representation
        with ``allowed_states=[0, 1, 2]`` use the classmethod
        :py:meth:`~Unilateral.trinary`.

        The ``max_time`` parameter defines the latest possible time step for a
        diagnosis. In the HMM case, the probability disitrubtion over all hidden states
        is evolved from :math:`t=0` to ``max_time``. In the BN case, this parameter has
        no effect.

        2. The spread probs from LNL to LNL. If the model is trinary, the microscopic
           parameter is set right after the corresponding LNL's spread prob.
        3. The growth parameters for each trinary LNL. For a binary model,

           two T-stages with distributions over diagnose times, this step requires four
           arguments.

        The order of the keyword arguments obviously does not matter. If one wants to
        set the microscopic or growth parameters globally for all LNLs, the keyword
        arguments ``micro_mod`` and ``growth`` can be used for that.

        Note:
            Providing positional arguments does not allow using the global
            parameters ``micro_mod`` and ``growth``.

        Since the distributions over diagnose times may take more than one parameter,
        they can be provided as keyword arguments by appending their name to the
        corresponding T-stage, separated by an underscore. For example, a parameter
        ``foo`` for the T-stage ``early`` is set via the keyword argument ``early_foo``.

        Note:
            When using keyword arguments to set the parameters of the distributions

            T-stage, even when the distribution only takes one parameter.
